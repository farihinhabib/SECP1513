I realize that in order to be successful in computer science in the next four years, building a strong foundation in understanding algorithms, data structures, and programming while discovering new technologies is important.
I have to stay updated with industry trends, connect with other programmers, and develop soft skills like communication and teamwork.
Balancing learning, hands-on experience, strengthening problem-solving abilities and networking will set me up for a successful career in this field.
